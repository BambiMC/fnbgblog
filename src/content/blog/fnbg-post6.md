### Disclaimer:

Changing any vbios settings CAN damage your card. I am not responsible for any damage to your card. Do this at your own risk.

### Why would you want to do this?

My AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT has a minimum fan speed of 25% in the VBIOS.

No software can set the fan speed below 25%.

So with 0 RPM mode enabled, the card will slowly get hotter and hotter until it reaches around 65Â° Celsius.
Now the wimpy fans kick in and the card will get cooler again. But then the fans will stop again and the card will get hotter again. This cycle repeats itself.

Its annoying!

But i don't want to flash the VBIOS, because i don't want to void my warranty.

So the solution is to use a tool called "MorePowerTool"! Link: https://www.igorslab.de/en/download-area-new-version-of-morepowertool-mpt-and-final-release-of-redbioseditor-rbe/

### How to use MorePowerTool:

1. Download the latest version of MorePowerTool from the link above.
2. Download the latest CPU-Z (must use techpowerup version) from here: https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/
3. Dump your VBIOS with GPU-Z:
